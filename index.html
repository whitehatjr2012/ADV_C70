          <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"> The food options and responsibilities to
            consider, canteens must be better organized and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus
            with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descripitions of their ingredients help both students
            and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could
            be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal
            choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and payin for meals
            online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and
            students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.

          <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"> Implemented Online attendance Management
            System: This informs parents about their child's/children's activities in the school, instantly. Once a
            student reaches the school, the parents will be informed about the status via text messages. This helps
            schools keep a record of the students' absences. Students can mark the attndanece by logging in, and this is
            stored in a database, which can later be checked by the Admin. The tracker has so much potential that it can
            identify which students are irregular to their classes and not ready to establish connectivity with the
            actual concepts of their curriculum's subjects. As soon as you enter a student's Enrollement Number or Name,
            details like availability in classes, number of lectures attended will be displayed and no proxies are
            possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be so robust
            and powerful that those students who always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span - just after the
            admin enters login details in to this tracker. All this will improve accuracy and transparency in any of the
            educational institutions as students and their parents are pre-informed about the real-time status of leave
            requests and absences in a confidential manner and at reduced costs.
